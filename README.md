# ðŸ“Š Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI

## âœ… 1. Business Problem

Amazonâ€™s business team was struggling to track sales trends and understand customer feedback across various product categories. They lacked a clear view of which products or categories were driving growth and which were underperforming. This made it difficult for them to plan marketing strategies, manage inventory, and improve customer satisfaction. With scattered data and limited visibility, they needed a solution to consolidate information and gain actionable insights.

## âœ… 2. Goal of the Dashboard

The objective of this project was to build an interactive and centralized Power BI dashboard that helps Amazonâ€™s team monitor sales and customer feedback efficiently. The dashboard was designed to:

âœ” Track year-to-date and quarterly sales trends.  
âœ” Identify top-performing product categories and individual products.  
âœ” Highlight customer preferences through review analysis.  
âœ” Provide a clear view of performance across regions and timeframes.

## âœ… 3. Tech Stack

The following tools and technologies were utilized to create this Power BI dashboard:

âœ” **Power BI Desktop** â€“ Used to create interactive and visually appealing reports and dashboards by connecting, transforming, and visualizing data.  
âœ” **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** â€“ Used for creating measures and calculated columns to perform advanced data analysis.  
âœ” **Power Query Editor** â€“ Used for data cleaning, shaping, and transforming raw data into usable formats.  
âœ” **Excel/CSV Files** â€“ Source data files used for sales, product categories, and customer reviews.  
âœ” **Data Modeling** â€“ Defined relationships between datasets to ensure accurate reporting and analysis.  
âœ” **Visualization Tools** â€“ Line charts, column charts, heat maps, and bar charts were used to display trends, patterns, and insights clearly.  
âœ” **Filters and Slicers** â€“ Enabled dynamic data exploration by allowing users to view data by product category and quarter.  
âœ” **Storytelling Techniques** â€“ Structured visuals to guide stakeholders through data insights and support decision-making.

## âœ… 4. Data Source

I used a sample dataset provide as part of an online Power BI learning resource. From this dataset, I extracted relevant data fields â€” like product names, categories, sales figures, and customer reviews â€” and transformed them to build a meaningful dashboard that simulates real-world business scenarios.

You can access the dataset from the tutorialâ€™s description or the course materials shared by the creator.

## âœ… 5. Walkthrough of Key Visuals

The dashboard includes multiple visuals to give a comprehensive view of the business performance:

- **YTD Sales by Month (Line Chart)**  
  â€“ Visualizes month-over-month sales to detect seasonal trends and revenue patterns.

- **YTD Sales by Week (Column Chart)**  
  â€“ Tracks weekly fluctuations to understand short-term changes in sales.

- **Sales by Product Category (Heat Map/Text Visual)**  
  â€“ Provides an overview of how different categories are contributing to total revenue.

- **Top 5 Products by YTD Sales (Bar Chart)**  
  â€“ Focuses on products generating the most revenue to prioritize supply chain and marketing.

- **Top 5 Products by YTD Reviews (Bar Chart)**  
  â€“ Analyzes customer feedback, helping identify products with high satisfaction and improving customer experience.

## âœ… 6. Highlighting the Insights

Through this dashboard, I found that **Menâ€™s Shoes and Cameras** were driving the highest revenue, while categories like **Mobile & Accessories** had very low sales. Additionally, customer reviews revealed that products like **SanDiskâ€™s memory cards** were receiving the most positive feedback, indicating strong customer trust in these products. The data also showed that certain regions had seasonal drops in sales, guiding the team to focus their strategies where improvement was needed most.

## âœ… 7. Business Impact

This dashboard empowered Amazonâ€™s stakeholders to shift from guesswork to data-driven decision-making. By analyzing sales and customer feedback, they could:

âœ” Optimize marketing efforts by targeting high-performing categories.  
âœ” Adjust inventory management based on product demand.  
âœ” Improve customer satisfaction by addressing feedback trends.  
âœ” Identify underperforming products and take corrective action.  
âœ” Plan for future growth by leveraging historical patterns and insights.
